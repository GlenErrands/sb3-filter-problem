# sb3-filter-problem
Repo to analyze problems during migration from SpringBoot2 (SB2) to SpringBoot3 (SB3)
The SB2 application works fine, but SB3 does not allow a login ....
the app has 3 elements for login (tenant, username and password) and a logout handler performs operations upon successful logout.
Both apps contain no tests as they are extracted and adapted from a different (private) project.

### Feature comparison between SB2 and SB3 version of the same application

| Description |   SB2    |    SB3     | Status          |
|:------------|:--------:|:----------:|:----------------|
| A           |  auser   |   auser    | üëç working      |
| A           |  auser   |   auser    | üî• not working  |

* login with 3 fields: tenant, username, password
* filter during logout to perform on-logout actions
* i18n

## How to run the app

### Working application with SB2

```
cd sb2 
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Launch the app via [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
and log in.
After a successful login you may logout again.

### Problematic application with SB3

```
cd sb3 
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Launch the app via [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

You are unable to login/logout .... which is the reason for this repository.

## Which credentials may I use?

You may use the following combination in order to successfully login:

| Tenant | Username | Password |
|:-------|:--------:|---------:|
| A      |  auser   |    auser |
| A      |  buser   |    buser |
| A      |  cuser   |    cuser |
| B      |  auser   |    auser |
| B      |  buser   |    buser |
| B      |  cuser   |    cuser |
| C      |  auser   |    auser |
| C      |  buser   |    buser |
| C      |  cuser   |    cuser |
